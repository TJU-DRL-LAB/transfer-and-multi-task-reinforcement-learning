## Baselines

We have covered the implementation of these following transfer RL methods, which are common used baselines presented in recent papers.

### Same-domain transfe:

- **PTF** - [IJCAI‘2020](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3491440.3491868)
<!-- - **CAPS** - [AAMAS’2019](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3306127.3331795)-->

### Cross-domain transfer:
<!-- - **MIKT** - [UAI’2020](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3306127.3331795)-->
<!-- - **Cycle-consistency** - [ICLR'2021](https://openreview.net/forum?id=QIRlze3I6hX) -->
- **CAT** - [UAI'2022](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ShN3hPUsce5) 


## Benchmarks (TODO)

We run transfer RL algorithms in the benchmarks: Gridworld, Pinball, and MuJoCo. Please follow the results below.
